p "Staircase!"

# Function to take in two Parameters
# n represents the amount of steps on the stair case 
# storage is in array that stores results to prevent redundant computation
# Function is recursive: Much like Fibbonacci sequence
# Returns number of ways to reach top of staircase
def stair_case n, storage
	# Exit code
	# When steps equals 0-1, only one way to reach top
	if n <= 1
		return 1
